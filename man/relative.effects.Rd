\title{Find relative effects for different base treatment and comparison treatments}
\usage{
relative.effects(result, base.treatment = NULL,
  comparison.treatments = NULL, base.category = NULL,
  comparison.categories = NULL, covariate = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{result}{object created by \code{\link{network.run}} function}

\item{base.treatment}{base treatment user wants for the relative effects. Base treatment is initially set by \code{\link{Treat.order}} parameter in \code{\link{network.data}} (first one in the list). If set to null, default is to use base treatment.}

\item{comparison.treatments}{treatments that user wants to compare against base treatment. If set to null, all the treatments besides base treatment is considered as comparison treatments.}

\item{base.category}{base category user wants for the relative effects. This is only used for multinomial data.}

\item{comparison.categories}{category that user wants to compare against base.category}

\item{covariate}{covariate value at which to compute relative effects.}
}
\value{
This returns a mcmc.list sample of relative effects for the base treatment specified. This allows user to obtain relative effects of different base.treatment after the sampling has been done.
For a simple summary use relative.effects.table.

#We can fit two different models with different base treatment and we can
#obtain same relative effects estimate using this function
#parkinsons

summary(result)
summary(relative.effects(result2, base.treatment = 1))

#This also works for comparing different base.category for multinomial.
#We fit two different models and compare the estimates again.
